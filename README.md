Rockwood, OR. has a horrible process for payment processing. Either you have to snail-mail them a check and authorization form for auto-payment (I don't have checks in this day and age, do you?), or you use a tedious and outdated website payment system, every month. I can't tell you how many times I've gotten late fees because I forgot to pay. We even had our water shut off once! So, here we have a Selenium based script that streamlines the process of making payment.
